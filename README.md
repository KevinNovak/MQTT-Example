# MQTT.js / Mosca Example
## MQTT.js in Browser with Mosca Broker

Didn't see many examples around so decided to put this out there.

Includes 2 examples:

1. **Embedded**
    * Mosca broker runs alongside an express application, as a single executable app  
2. **Standalone**
    * Mosca broker and express application run in seperate applications
